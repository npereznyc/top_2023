# Credit Hike

<h3>ðŸ’«View it <a href="credithike.netlify.app">Live</a></h3>

<h2> Project Description</h2>
An application that leverages federal data to empower consumers in the credit card market. Credit Hike was developed for The Opportunity Project, led by the US Census Bureau, the US Department of Commerce, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
<br />  
<br />  
Credit Hike is an educational tool that allows users to expand their financial literacy through the context of a simulated journey through credit card ownership so that they can learn how to make informed decisions regarding their financial future. Using the data set provided by the CFPB, we created an aggregate model of three credit card options for poor, fair, and good credit scores. The user can then go on a journey where they can select one of these cards and explore the fine print details of owning and using that card.
